# Assumptions

I made some assumptions on what to return instead of a null / empty string with null / empty input strings and strings that have been transformed into empty strings:

- If a null or empty string has been inputted into the transformer code, the transformer code will return 'Invalid String'
- In the case where the transformed string ends up being empty (such as trying to transform a string of "______" into ""), the transformer code will return 'Invalid String' because the acceptance criteria state not to return null or empty strings
